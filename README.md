### Bettergram

A snappy and clean alternative to Instagram.com. 

### Languages / Frameworks

On the server I am running a Rails server, which interacts with a Postgres database through ActiveRecord. In order to cache the results of API requests to Instagram, I also have a Redis server running, so that inifinite scroll on the user's feed page will be very quick. On the front end I use backbone.js.
